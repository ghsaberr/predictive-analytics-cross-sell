# Predictive Analytics for Cross-Sell Opportunities

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to identify banking customers who are most likely to be receptive to cross-sell offers for additional products and services. Using a real-world marketing dataset, the solution includes data exploration, feature engineering, model development and evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering for customer engagement and segmentation
- Multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Model evaluation with key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)

## Setup & Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ghsaberr/predictive-analytics-cross-sell
   cd Predictive-Analytics-for-Cross-Sell-Opportunities
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook predictive-analytics-for-cross-sell-opportunities.ipynb
   ```

## Key Insights
- Engagement metrics and customer demographics are strong predictors of cross-sell receptiveness.
- Gradient Boosting outperformed other models.
- Consistent preprocessing and automation are critical for reliable deployment.
